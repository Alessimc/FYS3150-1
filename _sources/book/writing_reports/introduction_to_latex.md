# Introduction to LaTeX


## What is LaTeX

Taken from the [LaTeX-projects website](https://www.latex-project.org/),

*LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents.*

## How do we write use it?

A LaTeX document is compiled from a `.tex` file which stores the source code. Typically, the compiler renders a `.pdf` file from the source code and creates a document with a specific format. Since this course typically involves collaboration, we recommend that you use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) for the compilation process.

## Templates

### Template for the two first projects:

We've prepared a template for you to use in the two first projects. We have both the source code found in a `.tex` and a rendered file in `.pdf` format.

- The [.tex file](./tex_mal/oppgave_mal.tex)
- The [.pdf file](./tex_mal/oppgave_mal.pdf)
