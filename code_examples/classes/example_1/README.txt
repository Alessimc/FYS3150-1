Example 1 of classes in C++
---------------------------

The entire example is contained in a single source file, main.cpp.

Normally when using classes the code for the class would be moved to a pair
of .hpp and .cpp files, e.g. include/myclass.hpp and src/myclass.cpp. 

See the other class examples for an illustration of this.


How to build and run the example
--------------------------------

Build: g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
Run: ./main.exe
