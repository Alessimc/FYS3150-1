Here we'll add a basic introduction to working in the sh.

## Basic commands

- Create a file called *filename* using the *touch* command

  ```sh
  touch filename
  ```

- Create a directory using the *mkdir* command

  ```sh
  mkdir directory_name
  ```

- Move a file called *filename* into a subdirectory called *subdir* using the *mv* command

  ```sh
  mv filename subdir
  ```

- Delete a file called *filename* using the *rm* command

  ```sh
  rm filename
  ```
- Copy a file called *filename* into a file *filename_copy* using the *cp* command

  ```sh

  ```

- Delete a directory called *dir* and its content using *rm* and the recursive flag *-r*

  ```sh

  ```
