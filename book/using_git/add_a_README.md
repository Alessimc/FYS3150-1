# Add a README

Make sure to add (and keep up to date) a file `README.md` at the base directory of your git repo. (GitHub will suggest adding such a file when you register a new repo.) The README file should contain a short explanation of how your repository is organized, and what commands others have to run to build and run the various codes.

You can format the file nicely using Markdown syntax, but it is also OK to just write plain text.
